# opengl-basics

A project with some basic code to work with OpenGL.
Nothing productive, just to understand how some things work.
Code might be "overcommented" for easier understanding.

Requires GLEW.

```
/**
 * 
 * OpenGL Pipeline
 * 
 * CPU: Vertex data
 * GPU:
 *   vertex processing (vertex shader): local, eye, clip, world
 *   primitive assembly: triangles, quads, lines, points
 *   rasterization: smoothing, multisampling
 *   fragment processing (fragment shader): alpha, depth, textures, stencil, 
 *   Framebuffer: pixels
 */ 
```
